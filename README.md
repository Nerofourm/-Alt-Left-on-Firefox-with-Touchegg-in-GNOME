# Alt+Left on Firefox with Touchegg in GNOME
This project configures the Touchegg library to enable navigating to the previous page in Mozilla Firefox using 3 fingers across the system, should you choose to modify the code.
## Setup
Ensure that you have installed the following libraries:

    Touchegg Library
    X11 Gestures Extension for GNOME

Please note that this setup may only function properly in the GNOME environment, as it relies on the x11 gestures specific to GNOME, primarily for disabling desktop swipe functionality.
